                        I've spent my entire career believing that space technology serves humanity's greater good. 
                        That our satellites bring communication, navigation, and understanding to billions of people. 
                        That the work we do in orbital mechanics pushes the boundaries of human achievement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But what happens when the tools we build are repurposed? When systems designed for observation 
                        become instruments of surveillance? When transparency gives way to opacity, and accountability 
                        disappears behind classification walls?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I can't stay silent anymore.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the past few months, I've witnessed decisions that trouble me deeply. Projects that started 
                        with noble intentions being quietly redirected. Orbital parameters changed without proper oversight. 
                        Questions met with reassurances that "it's above your clearance level."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As engineers and scientists, we have a responsibility that goes beyond our employment contracts. 
                        We have a duty to ensure our work doesn't cause harm. To ask hard questions. To demand accountability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The autonomous systems we develop are powerful. They can track, observe, and collect data with 
                        unprecedented precision. But power without oversight is dangerous. Technology without ethics 
                        is a weapon.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've been told to "trust the process." To "stay in my lane." To remember that I signed NDAs 
                        and security clearances for a reason.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But trust must be earned. And right now, I'm not sure who deserves mine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you're reading this and you work in this field, ask yourself: Do you know what your systems 
                        are really being used for? Have you asked the hard questions? Or have you, like I did for too 
                        long, simply accepted the narrative you were given?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I don't have all the answers. I'm still trying to understand what I've seen and what it means. 
                        But I know this: silence is complicity.

                        I've been documenting some of my work there. Not everything—I can't share classified 
                        information—but enough to show the patterns I'm seeing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To my colleagues: I'm sorry if this causes problems. But I can't keep pretending everything is fine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To those in positions of power: Prove me wrong. Show me the transparency I'm asking for. 
                        Demonstrate that these systems serve their stated purposes and nothing else.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To everyone else: Pay attention. Ask questions. Don't let the stars become tools of oppression.
